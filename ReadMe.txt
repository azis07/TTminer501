-coinALT           same as -coin, just for the alternate algo

-work-timeout      NOT supported (ignored)

-compute INT       force the miner to use a certain compute version. You can add one value for all GPUs or for each
                   GPU a separate value. V value of -1 uses the cards compute level.

-i, -intensity     Comma or space separated list of intensities that should be used mining. First value
                   for first GPU and so on. A single value sets the same intensity to all GPUs. A value
                   of -1 uses the default intensity of the miner. A sample may look like this:
   -i 18,17,-1,18  sets intensity of 18 to the first and fourth GPU, 17 to the second and the third
                   keeps the default of the miner. The GPUs are the GPUs you may have selected with
                   the -d parameter. If you have installed 6 GPUs and use -d 3 4, the parameter -i 19 18
                   will set the intensity of 19 to your system GPU 3 and 18 to GPU 4.

-iALT              same as -i, just for the alternate algo

-ig, -gs           intensity grid/grid-size. Same as intensity (-i, -intensity) just defines the size for the grid directly.
                   This will give you more and finer control about the number of threads that should run on the gpu.

-gsALT             same as -gs, just for the alternate algo


-ib, -bs           not supported! intensity block/block-size. Allows to define a fixed block size for the cuda kernel. If you do
                   not specify thzis option TT-Miner will try to find the best value for the blocksize.

-tstop             Stop mining on a GPU if temperature exceeds value. 0 is disabled. Default: 0
-tstart            Restart mining on a GPU if the temperature drops below. Default: 40


                   API options Monitor/Control:
-b, --api-bind     IP[:port] enables the monitoring API of TT-Miner to the IP address. If you
                             omit the port, port 4068 is used as default
--api-type         Protocol  TCP/WebSocket - parameter ignored
--api-password     password  assigns a password to the API


                   Parameter without argument
-RH, -rate         Reports the current hashrate every 90 seconds to the pool
-n, -list, -ndevs  List the detected CUDA devices and exit
-logpool           Enable logging of the pool communication. TT-Miner creates the pool-logfile in the folder 'Logs'.
-log               Enable logging of screen output and additional information, the file is created in the folder 'Logs'.
-poolinfo, -pi     Show information of the active pool
-luck              Show a second information line that shows you how long it should take to find a new solution (share).

                   Additionally the time already spend on the new solutions is printed and also a 'luck' value
                   in percent that shows you the progress. Values below 100% indicate that there is still time
                   left until the next solution should be found. Values above 100% indicate that the miner needs
                   more time to find the new share than expected. These values are 'long term' statistical
                   indications.
-U, --nvidia       Mining using CUDA devices (just for combability - can be omitted)
-X                 Mining with OpenCL (just for combability - NOT supported)
-G, --amd          Mining using AMD devices (just for combability - NOT supported)
-h, --help         Show this help and exit
-v, --version      Show TT-Miner version and exit
-nocolor           Disables color output
-notimestamp       Disables timestamp in output
-ccd               Create a crashdump file for debugging (default: no crashdump created)


                    Pool definition - defines all values that are required for a connection to a mining pool.
-P                  [scheme://]user/wallet[.workername/username][:password]@hostname:port

                    The minimal definition to connect to a pool is:
                    -P YOUR_WALLET@YOUR_SERVER_IP:YOUR_SERVER_PORT

                    With all options it look like this
                    -P stratum+tcp://YOUR_WALLET.YOUR_WORKER:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_SERVER_IP:YOUR_SERVER_PORT

                    'stratum+tcp://' is not required because TT-Miner will try to detect which stratum protocol is in use.
                    The first -P will define your primary pool, all following -P definition will work as
                    backup/failover pool.

-PALT               same as -P, just for the alternate algo

-o, -pool, -url     YOUR_SERVER_IP:YOUR_SERVER_POOL
-u, -user, -wal     YOUR_WALLET[.YOUR_WORKER] or YOUR_USER
-p, -pass           YOUR_PASSWORD
-w, -worker         YOUR_WORKER

                    Same set for the alternate coin if you mine EPIC
-oALT               YOUR_SERVER_IP:YOUR_SERVER_POOL
-uALT               YOUR_WALLET[.YOUR_WORKER] or YOUR_USER
-pALT               YOUR_PASSWORD
-wALT               YOUR_WORKER

-pool2              YOUR_BACKUP_SERVER_IP:YOUR_BACKUP_SERVER_POOL
-user2, wal2        YOUR_BACKUP_WALLET[.YOUR_BACKUP_WORKER] or YOUR_BACKUP_USER
-pass2              YOUR_BACKUP_PASSWORD
-worker2            YOUR_BACKUP_WORKER

-PP INT             Process-Priority
                    This option set the process priority for TT-Miner to a different level:
                    1 low
                    2 below normal
                    3 normal
                    4 above normal
                    5 high
                    Default: -PP 3

                    Screen-Output
-PRGN               Performance-Report GPU-name
                    Prints the name/model in the performance report

-PRHRI INT          Performance-Report Hash-Rate Interval
                    Performance-Report & information after INT multiple of one minute. Minimum value for INT is
                    1 which creates a hashrate interval of a minute. Higher Intervals gives you a more stable
                    hashrate. If the interval is too high the displayed average of your hashrate will change
                    very slowly. The default of 2 will give you an average of 2 minutes.
                    Default: -PRHRI 2

-PRT INT            Performance-Report & information after INT multiple of 5 seconds
                    Set INT to 0 to disable output after a fixed timeframe
                    sample -RPT 24 shows the performance report after 24 * 5 sec = 2 minutes
                    Default: -PRT 3

-PRS INT            Performance-Report & information after a INT shares found
                    Set INT to 0 to disable output after a fixed number of shares
                    sample -RPS 10 shows the performance report after 10 shares were found
                    Default: -PRS 0

                    Mixed sample:
                    - You want to see the performance report all 25 shares and all 30 secs:
                        -PRS 25 -PRT 6
                    - You do not want to see any performance report:
                        -PRT 0
